Welcome to pylib/randomlib!
I bundled these two together because they're really similar. You can create your own madlibs in python! pylib has more syntax, because it uses user input, but randomlib only has nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Thanks to eslgrammar or something else for providing these lists of stuff. Now, time to show you how to use the programs!
HOW TO USE PYLIB:
	1) Open pylib.py.
	2) Enter your mad-lib directory with the correct syntax.
		2.1) If you don't know the syntax, open up pylibSyntax.txt.
	3) If you have correct syntax, some inputs will show up.
	4) Have Fun!
HOW TO USE RANDOMLIB:
	1) Open any terminal of your choice.
		1.1) Please make sure you have python installed.
	2) Navigate to the directory of randomlib.py.
	3) Use python to open randomlib.py.
		3.1) Use --(madlib here) --(times to generate)
		3.2) Make sure you have the right syntax! Open randomlibSyntax.txt
	4) Have fun laughing at these randomly generated stories!
